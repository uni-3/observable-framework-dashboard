# Framework Dashboard

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) app. To install the required dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

Then, to start the local preview server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000> to preview your app.

For more, see <https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started>.

## Setup

This project uses environment variables to manage database connections.

### Local Environment

1. Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the root directory (refer to `.env.sample`).
   - `.env.local` is recommended for local overrides as it is typically gitignored.
2. Set the following variables:
   - `DUCKDB_DATABASE`: Path to your local DuckDB file or MotherDuck connection string (e.g., `md:` or `md:my_db`).
   - `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`: Your MotherDuck token (required if using MotherDuck).

### GitHub Pages Deployment

To enable data loading from MotherDuck during the GitHub Actions build, you must configure **GitHub Repository Secrets**:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
3. Add the following secrets:
   - `DUCKDB_DATABASE`: Set to `md:` or your specific MotherDuck database name.
   - `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`: Your MotherDuck service token.

## Project structure

A typical Framework project looks like this:

```ini
.
├─ src
│  ├─ components
│  │  └─ timeline.js           # an importable module
│  ├─ data
│  │  ├─ launches.csv.js       # a data loader
│  │  └─ events.json           # a static data file
│  ├─ example-dashboard.md     # a page
│  ├─ example-report.md        # another page
│  └─ index.md                 # the home page
├─ .gitignore
├─ observablehq.config.js      # the app config file
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

**`src`** - This is the “source root” — where your source files live. Pages go here. Each page is a Markdown file. Observable Framework uses [file-based routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/project-structure#routing), which means that the name of the file controls where the page is served. You can create as many pages as you like. Use folders to organize your pages.

**`src/index.md`** - This is the home page for your app. You can have as many additional pages as you’d like, but you should always have a home page, too.

**`src/data`** - You can put [data loaders](https://observablehq.com/framework/data-loaders) or static data files anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here.

**`src/components`** - You can put shared [JavaScript modules](https://observablehq.com/framework/imports) anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here. This helps you pull code out of Markdown files and into JavaScript modules, making it easier to reuse code across pages, write tests and run linters, and even share code with vanilla web applications.

**`observablehq.config.js`** - This is the [app configuration](https://observablehq.com/framework/config) file, such as the pages and sections in the sidebar navigation, and the app’s title.
